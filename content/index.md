title: About me
---

I am a programmer and parent by day, and a physicist by night. I live in Uppsala, Sweden, where I work as a systems developer at [Uppsala Monitoring Centre](https://who-umc.org/), developing and maintaining a web-based system for monitoring the safety of medicines. I have a Masters degree in Engineering Physics, and a PhD in theoretical physics, both from [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/). I have a stipend from the Lennanders foundation for pursuing research which focuses on theoretical methods for early-universe phase transitions. Currently I am on 50% parental leave.

I am interested in establishing consistent methods for describing first order phase transitions in field theory. I have previously focused on the issues of gauge invariance and IR divergences, and now I am looking to develop and use EFT methods for these calculations.

On the programming side I have professional experience writing C# and TypeScript, and hobby-level experience writing Julia, F# and Haskell. I am passionate about functional programming.

### Papers
Here is a curated subset of my published papers—for a full list of my papers, see [my Inspire page](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1657891).[^namenote] (The links below are all to the Inspire database, from which both the published version and the preprint ArXiv version of the paper can be reached.)

1. [On the relationship between gauge dependence and IR divergences in the ℏ-expansion of the effective potential (JHEP, 2019)](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1696811)\
*Andreas Ekstedt, Johan Löfgren*
    > We show that certain IR divergences of the Fermi gauge effective potential cannot be removed via a particular resummation method. Instead one should perform a strict expansion (known as the ℏ-expansion).
2. [A Critical Look at the Electroweak Phase Transition (JHEP, 2020)](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1802542)\
*Andreas Ekstedt, Johan Löfgren*
    > We demonstrate how to establish gauge invariance in models with radiative barriers. Our main point is that one should use a modified power counting in which the scalar coupling $\lambda$ is of the size $\lambda \sim g^3$, where $g$ is the gauge coupling.
3. [A new perspective on the electroweak phase transition in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (JHEP, 2021)](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1853473)\
*José Eliel Camargo-Molina, Rikard Enberg, Johan Löfgren*
    > We use power-counting methods to show that there is non-excluded parameter-space in the SMEFT where a first-order electroweak phase transition occurs.
4. [Computing the gauge-invariant bubble nucleation rate in finite temperature effective field theory (JHEP, 2022)](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1992047)\
*Joonas Hirvonen, Johan Löfgren, Michael J. Ramsey-Musolf, Philipp Schicho, Tuomas V.I. Tenkanen*\
[Nucleation at Finite Temperature: A Gauge-Invariant Perturbative Framework (PRL, 2023)](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1987866)\
*Johan Löfgren, Michael J. Ramsey-Musolf, Philipp Schicho, Tuomas V.I. Tenkanen*
    > In this pair of papers, we show how to perform a gauge-invariant calculation of the nucleation rate in models with radiative barriers. This work emphasizes that a combination of modern 3D EFT methods and the modified expansion $\lambda \sim g^3$ is enough to consistently calculate gauge-invariant nucleation rates when dealing with radiative barriers.
5. [Radiative first-order phase transitions to next-to-next-to-leading order](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2082546)\
*Andreas Ekstedt, Oliver Gould, Johan Löfgren*
    > This work is also a synthesis of modern 3D EFT methods, and mine and Andreas's work on the $\lambda \sim g^3$ expansion. Here we develop new perturbative techniques by performing a consistent combination of 3D EFT techniques and the modified expansion. Then we use these techniques to calculate static thermodynamical quantities in the SU(2)+Higgs model to higher orders than previously reached. We compare our perturbative calculations to lattice simulations and find good agreement.

6. [Stop comparing resummation methods](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2622621)\
*Johan Löfgren*
    > In this essay I argue that resummation methods should be backed up by top-down EFTs, and that once an approximation scheme is chosen it is meaningless to compare resummation methods. Furthermore, using EFT methods together with strict expansions dissolves many confusing problems related to phase transition calculations.
